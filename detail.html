                <p class="article-body"><strong>What is AI ?</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     AI is a set of technological tools and algorithms that provides us with predictions, 
                     recommendations, and decisions to alter digital and real environments that are based on various data.
                     Artificial intelligence is supposed to perform the tasks that initially were considered to be 
                     predominantly done by humans.<br>
                     AI has two major subsets, which are machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
                     To provide you with the definitions of ML and DL, let’s draw the following distinction 
                     between how humans and machines differentiate between two objects. Without going into 
                     details about how your brains work, you, as a human being, can easily and quickly set 
                     things apart due to your past experiences. But how can machines do this? How can they 
                     distinguish between two things? They do it with the help of ML and DL.<br><br>
                     <b>How Can Artificial Intelligence Benefit Humans?</b><br>
                     Drug discovery can be not the only AI benefit this technology can provide humans with. Another challenge that 
                     humanity is facing right now and which can be prevented with the help of AI is the discovery of 
                     new and sustainable materials.<br><br>
                     <b>Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Everyday Life:</b><br>
                     How does artificial intelligence affect our lives in other spheres? You might not even notice it, but one of the 
                     main manifestations of AI is in the way we entertain ourselves and meet new people, or encounter 
                     our partners online. We, as smart human beings, will always derive considerable pleasure out of 
                     books, music, TV shows, and movies we like. And without giving it much thought about what lies 
                     behind our everyday activities, we use recommendation systems to choose entertainment for our 
                     liking. These are just a few uses of artificial intelligence in daily life. And the chances 
                     are — you know these AI-powered examples very well.<br><br>
                     1) YouTube recommendation engine <br><br>
                     <centre> <img src="image/i1.png" width="8000px" height="300px"></centre>
                     <br>Owned by Google, YouTube is probably one of the most popular platforms for sharing video content 
                     in the world. You can find whatever your heart desires — from various beauty and cooking tutorials 
                     to music videos, vlogs, and news. According to Omnicore, YouTube has 2 billion active users monthly 
                     and 30 million active users per day. Although the number of viewers is huge, the platform uses AI 
                     to provide viewers with the videos that they are interested in and block those that, for instance, 
                     might be terrorism-related or have any other violent nature.<br><br>
                     2)Netflix recommendation engine<br><br>
                     Why is Netflix so popular? It just knows what you want and what you most likely will love to watch. 
                     The company is at the forefront of the entertainment industry as the leading content creator. Its recommendation 
                     system or engine comes up with TV show and movie suggestions that are based on your viewing history. Moreover, 
                     Netflix calculates how many times you’ve seen a particular film or TV series, rewound, or fast-forwarded, not to 
                     mention how you have rated content.<br>
                     <centre> <img src="image/i2.png" width="8000px" height="300px"></centre>
                     <br>
                     In one of the Wired articles, it was stated how machine learning boosts this recommendation system. People at 
                     Netflix have all the necessary information about your preferences at their fingertips. They know what content you 
                     have watched and when. The employees and freelancers also view all the Netflix video content and tag it. The tags 
                     contain various information — setting, character, or cast. Then they use ML algorithms, user behavior data, and 
                     these tags to understand what things are the most important and what matters the most.<br>
                     Netflix has multiple groups that vary according to different criteria and as a result, you get TV shows and movies 
                     that you like and even your video thumbnails are different.
