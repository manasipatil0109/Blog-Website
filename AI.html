                <p class="article-body"><strong>What is AI ?</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     AI is a set of technological tools and algorithms that provides us with predictions, 
                     recommendations, and decisions to alter digital and real environments that are based on various data.
                     Artificial intelligence is supposed to perform the tasks that initially were considered to be 
                     predominantly done by humans.<br>
                     AI has two major subsets, which are machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
                     To provide you with the definitions of ML and DL, let’s draw the following distinction 
                     between how humans and machines differentiate between two objects. Without going into 
                     details about how your brains work, you, as a human being, can easily and quickly set 
                     things apart due to your past experiences. But how can machines do this? How can they 
                     distinguish between two things? They do it with the help of ML and DL.

                <p class="article-body"><br>
                    The impacts of artificial intelligence is not only visible but also tangible. 
                    Take out your Android phone and say, “Ok, Google.” Once you’ve uttered it, 
                    you’ll hear a pleasant woman’s voice. This is artificial intelligence in its 
                    manifestation as virtual assistants, or, as sometimes also called chatbots. 
                    However, it should be noted that some companies and people still prefer to 
                    distinguish between chatbots and virtual assistants.
                    <br>
                    Many major companies offer their own artificial intelligence assistants: 
                    Microsoft uses Cortana, Samsung Electronics utilizes Bixby, Amazon has Alexa, 
                    Apple offers Siri, and Google has Google assistant, respectively. These AIs 
                    can understand human commands and respond accordingly. For instance, Siri can 
                    turn the music at your place, or Google Assistant can type a message for your 
                    friend at your request, or Alexa can open your Uber app. But, AI in your 
                    smartphone will be able to go far beyond.

                    <p class="article-body">
                        AI is being increasingly incorporated by doctors to transcribe, read, 
                        analyze, and make predictions based on notes and conversations between 
                        physicians and their patients. This opens up new possibilities for care and 
                        new concerns about privacy, according to a recent account from Axios. <br><br>
                        A big and largely invisible contribution AI can make is to capture a 
                        physician’s written or spoken notes automatically. Spending hours entering 
                        data manually into electronic health records (EHRs) is not helpful to medical 
                        professionals close to burning out.   <br><br>
                        
                        A recent study from researchers at the University of New Mexico, outlined in 
                        EHR Intelligence, found that 13% of stress and burnout self-reported by 
                        physicians were directly correlated to EHRs. Philip Kroth, MD, director of 
                        Biomedical Informatics Research at UNM, found that 40% of clinician stress 
                        is related to clinical process design and structure, both of which are very 
                        much correlated with EHRs  </p>

                    <p class="article-body"><strong>AI Detects COVID-19 X-Rays</strong><br>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        AI-enabled software is up to interpret images and diagnose you with a disease almost 
                        accurately. Just have a look at a neural-network application CheXNet. You just need to open 
                        the CheXNet app, take a picture of your x-ray, and voila, within a few seconds, the app 
                        outputs all diseases that you possibly have. Importantly, they are sorted by the order from 
                        the most likely to least likely, so you know what specialist to address.<br><br>

                        Another x-ray system called qXR has originally detected the varieties of lung abnormalities. 
                        But after the outburst of coronavirus, this AI technology has taught itself to identify the 
                        symptoms of pneumonia caused by this deadly virus. As a result, qXR distinguishes between 
                        COVID and non-COVID x-ray samples with an impressive accuracy of 95%.<br><br>
                        
                        With the help of deep learning, AI has trained itself to recognize patterns and identify 
                        diseases in new x-rays. So, normally done by doctors, x-ray analysis can now be successfully 
                        managed by machines..  </p>
